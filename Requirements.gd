#10 x 20 playable, 4 higher for starting a block
#
#3 long blocks, 3 colors randomly

#rotates the colors but not sideways, ala columns
#
#need to get 4 blocks together vertical or horizontal
#
#bigger combos are worth more in the charge bar
#
#there's a charge bar for each color
#
#once the bar fills, all three empty and a special goes off that removes most/all of that color's enemy
#
#R > G > B > R ie red beats green, green beats blue, blue beats red
